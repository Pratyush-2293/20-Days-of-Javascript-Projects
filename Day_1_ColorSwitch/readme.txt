Color Switch Project
- In this project I have made a website with a button that changes the background color of the website when pressed.
- There are 7 Colors of the rainbow in an array.
- By making use of the Math.random() function, we change the color of the background to a random color from the array of 7 colors.
- All the files of the project are included in this folder.
