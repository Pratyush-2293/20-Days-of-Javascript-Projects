Jumping Game Project
- In this project I have made a website with a jumping game
- The player character is represented by Mario.
- The player can jump by clicking anywhere on the webpage.
- Player must jump over the enemy representd by the goombas.
- If the player collides with the goomba, a game over alert is shown
- The page must be reloaded to restart the game.

Test Case:
- Case 0: The webpage is clicked anywhere.
- Case 1: The player is collided with the enemy.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: The player character jumps, and the score is incremented by one.
- Case 1: A game over alert is shown and game stops.
