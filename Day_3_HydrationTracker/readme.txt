Hydration Tracker Project
- In this project I have made a website where the user can keep track of their personal hydration (total water intake) to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
- The user can add a glass of water to the counter by clicking the 'add glass' button.
- The counter can be reset by pressing the 'reset day' button.
- Upon reset, the website sends a message to the user based on their water intake for the day.

Test Cases:
Case 0: The 'add glass' button is clicked.
Case 1: The 'reset day' button is clicked.
Case 2: The reset button is clicked when the total number of glasses drank is less than 8.
Case 3: The reset button is clicked when the total number of glasses drank is more than 7 and less than 16.
Case 4: The reset button is clicked when the total number of glasses drank is more than 15.

Expected Output:
Case 0: 1 is displayed on the counter.
Case 1: an alert is sent and the counter is set to 0.
Case 2: An alert says to drink more water, and counter is set to 0.
Case 3: An alert appreciates your good hydration level, and counter is set to 0.
Case 4: An alert warns you everytime counter goes over 15 and advising against over consumption of water, and counter is set to 0.
