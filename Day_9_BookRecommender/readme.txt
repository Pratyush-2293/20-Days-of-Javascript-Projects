Book Recommender App
- In this project I have made an application that recommends a random book from its library.
- It's internal library is equipped with the most popular books of all time.
- When the "new book" button is clicked, it displays the data of a random book from its library.
- The book data includes, book title, author's name, and book price as per amazon.in .

Test Case:
- The 'new book' button is pressed a few times.

Expeted Output:
- The app diplays the book data everytime the button is pressed.
