Space Flyer Web Game (Using Vanilla JS)
- In this project I have made a website with a web game using vanilla JS.
- In the game, the player controls a spaceship, which can fly in one of three lanes.
- The player must avoid incoming asteroids (which appear randomly in one of three lanes) by flying to the right or left to dodge them.
- The player can change lanes by clicking on either the left or right side of the screen.
- Changing lanes increases the player score by 1. 
- The player must try to maximise the shifting of lanes while avoiding asteroids to achieve highest possible score.

Test Cases:
Case 0: The player starts the game.
Case 1: The left side of the screen is clicked.
Case 2: The right side of the screen is clicked.
Case 3: The player (deliberately) crashes into the asteroid.

Expected Output:
Case 0: The game starts and asteroids spawn randomly in one of the three lanes at a time.
Case 1: The player's spaceship shifts to the left lane.
Case 2: The player's spaceship shifts rightward and returns to the center lane.
Case 3: The game stops and a game over alert is displayed, along with the player's achieved scored.

You can play the game by clicking on the link below:
Note: If the spaceship is not visible to you in your browser window, please go to webpage options and zoom out until spaceship is visible.
