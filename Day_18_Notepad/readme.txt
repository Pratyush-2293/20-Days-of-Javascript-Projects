Notepad Project (Downloadable Notes)
- In this project I have made a website with a notepad app in which we can take notes.
- We can give the note a name, in the file name section.
- By pressing the save button, it saves the note to a .txt file with the given file title and downloads it.

Test Case:
Case 0: Text "Lorem Ipsum" is typed into the note taking area (text area), and the text "Quick Fox" is typed into the file name area.
Case 1: The save button is pressed.

Expected Output:
Case 0: The text "Lorem Ipsum" appears in the note text area and "Quick Fox" appears on the file name text box.
Case 1: A .txt file is downloaded with the title "Quick Fox". The contents of the Quick Fox.txt read "Lorem Ipsum".
