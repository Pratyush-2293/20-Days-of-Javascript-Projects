QR Code Generator Browser Extension Project
- In this project I have made a website and a browser extension that generates a QR Code of the given link / text.
- The generated QR Code can be downloaded by pressing the download button.

Test Cases (Browser Extension):
- Case 0: The extension icon is clicked.
- Case 1: "www.google.com" is typed into the input box, and the "Get QR" button is clicked.
- Case 2: The "download" button below the QR Code is clicked.
- Case 3: The generated QR Code is scanned with a Mobile Device.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: The Extension pop-up is displayed.
- Case 1: A new QR code is generated and displayed.
- Case 2: The QR code is downloaded as a .png image file.
- Case 3: www.google.com website is opened upon scanning the QR Code.

- Enable Developer Mode.
- Click on "Load Unpacked" and choose the "QR Generator Extension" folder that we had unpacked from the zip file.
- The Extension has been added to your browser, you may now click on it in your extensions list and use it like a regular extension.

This is the final project for my 20 Days of Javascript Projects.
