Flappy Bird Game
- In this project I have made a flappy bird game in javascript using the kaboom.js library.
- The objective of the player is to fly through the gaps in the pipes and achieve highest possible score.
- Player can fly by pressing the space button.
- Hitting the pipes or going out of the screen bounds results in a game over.

Test Cases:
- Case 0: The game is loaded.
- Case 1: The space button is pressed
- Case 2: The bird is flown through the gap in the pipes
- Case 3: The bird collides with the pipes

Expected Output:
- Case 0: The game starts, with the pipes moving leftwards, and the bird falling down due to gravity.
- Case 1: The bird flies higher once.
- Case 2: The score increases by 1.
- Case 3: The game over screen is showed along with the current score and the high score.
