RGB Cursor Project
- In this project I have made a website in which the user's cursor gets transformed into a custom cursor.
- The cursor will make use of animations and will change its color over time throughout the RGB color values range.
- The custom mouse will disappear after the user moves his/her mouse out of the website window.

Test Case:
- Case 0: The mouse is moved into the webpage window.
- Case 1: The mousee is moved out off the webpage window.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: The user's mouse cursor get converted to a custom cursor upon entering the webpage window. 
- Case 1: The user's mouse cursor returns to windows default cursor and the custom cursor in the webpage disappears.
