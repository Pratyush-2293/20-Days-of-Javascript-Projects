Math Quiz Project
- In this project I have made a website in which the user can play a simple math quiz.
- This quiz is intended for young children as it contains only basic mathematical operations.
- The player can choose to recieve one of four types of questions.
- The options are: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
- The player must choose the correct option from the given option choices, only one of the 3 options are correct.
- If the player gives the correct option, an alert will congratulate them and a new question will be generated.
- If the player gives the wrong answer, an alert will tell them that its a wrong answer and will allow the player to attempt it again.

Test Cases:
- Case 0: The option with the wrong answer is clicked.
- Case 1: The option with the correct answer is clicked.
- Case 2: The subtraction mode is selected by clicking on it.
- Case 3: The multiplication mode is selected by clicking on it.
- Case 4: The division mode is selected by clicking on it.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: An alert is shown, which says that the submitted answer is wrong.
- Case 1: An alert is show, which says that the submitted answer is correct.
- Case 2: A new question is generated, this time it is a subtraction question.
