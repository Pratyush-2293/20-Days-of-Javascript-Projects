Space Invaders Project
- In this project I have made a web game based on the game "Space Invaders".
- If you are not familiar with the game Space Invaders, you can check out the rules and gameplay here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders
- The player can move their spaceship left or right by pressing the left and right arrow keys respectively.
- The player can shoot using the spacebar.
- The enemies die upon being hit by a bullet.
- The enemies keep moving left and right and will slowly move their way downwards towards the player's spaceship.
- If the enemies touch the player's spaceship, or if the enemies fly past the player and move out of screen bounds, it will lead to a gameover.

Test Cases:
- Case 0: The game is loaded.
- Case 1: The left arrow is pressed, followed by the right arrow.
- Case 2: The spacebar is pressed.
- Case 3: The enemy is hit by a bullet.
- Case 4: All enemies on the board are killed.
- Case 5: The game is loaded again, and the enemies are allowed to touch the player/go out of sreen bounds.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: The game begins successfully, with the enemies moving left and right.
- Case 1: The spaceship moves left, and then moves right.
- Case 2: The spaceship shoots a bullet.
- Case 3: The enemy and the bullet are both destroyed, and a hit sound is played.
- Case 4: "You Win!" text is displayed on the screen.
- Case 5: The "Game Over!" screen is displayed.
