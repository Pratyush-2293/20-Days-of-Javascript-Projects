To Do List App
- In this project I have made a website with a to do list app.
- The user can add events to the list, by typing in the input section, and clicking the yellow note button.
- Clicking on the items added to the list, checks them off by adding a strike-through to the text.
- Clicking on the red trash can button clears the list of all events.

Test Cases:
- Case 0: The text "Play Among Us" is types in the input section, and the yellow note button is clicked.
- Case 1: The text item "Play Among Us" in the list is clicked.
- Case 2: The red trash can button is clicked.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: The text "Play Among Us" is added to the list.
- Case 1: The text "Play Among Us" is now checked off with a strikethrough.
- Case 2: The list is cleared of all items.
