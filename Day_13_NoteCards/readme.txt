Note Cards Project
- In this project I have made a website to create post-it card notes.
- The user can create a new note, by clicking the "create note" button.
- A created note can be deleted by double cliking the note on the board.
- New note cards are created with different colors.

Test Cases:
- Case 0: The "create a note" button is clicked.
- Case 1: "Hello, Testing !" is typed in the input box, and the green check mark is clicked.
- Case 2: The red cross button is clicked.
- Case 3: The created note is double clicked.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: The new note creation window is opened.
- Case 1: A new note card is created with the text "Hello, Testing !".
- Case 2: The note creation window is closed.
- Case 3: The created note is deleted.
