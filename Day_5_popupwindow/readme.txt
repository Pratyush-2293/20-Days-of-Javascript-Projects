Pop Up Window Project
- In this project I have made a website to demonstrate the implementation of a pop-up window.
- The pop up window function was written from scratch using vanilla JS.
- Clicking of the 'click me' button will open a sample pop up window.
- Clicking on the cross button closes the pop up window.

Test Cases:
- Case 0: The button 'click me' is pressed.
- Case 1: The 'X' button on the pop up window is pressed.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: The pop up window is now visible.
- Case 1: The pop up window closes.
