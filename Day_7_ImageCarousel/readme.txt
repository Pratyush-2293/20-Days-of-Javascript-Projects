Image Slider Project
- In this project I have made a website that demonstrates the implementation of an image carousel, also known as an image slider.
- There are a total of 5 images in this carousel.
- Clicking the left and right arrow buttons changes the image towards the left or right repectively.
- A sliding transition is also played when changing through images.

Test Case:
- The right arrow is clicked 4 times.
- The left arrow is clicked 4 times.

Expected Output:
- The image carousel slides towards the right 4 times, displaying a new image every time.
- The image carousel slides towards the left 4 times, displaying the previous images in reverse order every time.
