Calculator Project
- In this project I have made a website with a calculator.
- The calculator can perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
- The calculator also updates the user input on its display screen in real time.

Test Cases:
- Case 0: Press 2, Press "+" Press 4.
- Case 1: Press 4, Press "-" Press 2.
- Case 2: Press 3, Press "*" Press 3.
- Case 3: Press 8, Press "/" Press 2.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: 6
- Case 1: 2
- Case 2: 9
- Case 3: 4
