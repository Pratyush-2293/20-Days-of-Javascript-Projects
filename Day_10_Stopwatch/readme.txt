Stopwatch App
- In this project I have made a websaite with a stopwatch app.
- The stopwatch has 3 buttons that perform 3 functions.
- The start button starts counting time.
- The stop button pauses the watch.
- The reset button sets the time back to 0.

Test Cases:
- Case 0: The start button is pressed.
- Case 1: The stop button is pressed.
- Case 2: The start button is pressed again.
- Case 3: The stop button is pressed again.
- Case 4: The reset button is pressed.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: The stopwatch starts counting time.
- Case 1: The stopwatch pauses.
- Case 2: The stopwatch resumes counting time.
- Case 3: The stopwatch pauses again.
- Case 4: The stopwatch resets back to 0.
