Password Generator Project
- In this project I have made a website with an app that generates relatively strong passwords.
- The passwords are generated randomly from a library of characters that most sites and services permit to be used in a password.
- Clicking the new button generates a new password.
- Clicking the save button saves that password to the passwords list below.

Test Cases:
- Case 0: The new button is clicked.
- Case 1: The save button is clicked.
- Case 2: Case 0 & 1 are repeated in order once again.

Expected Output:
- Case 0: A new password is generated in the password generation field.
- Case 1: The password in the screen above is copied and stored in the list below.
- Case 2: A new password is generated and then saved to the list below.
